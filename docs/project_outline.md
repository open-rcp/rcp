# RCP Project Outline and Development Guidelines

This document outlines the Remote Control Protocol (RCP) project structure, components, and planned development roadmap.

## Project Components

### Core Components

- **RCP Core**: Protocol definitions, framing, authentication mechanisms
- **RCP Server**: Server implementation for handling client connections

- **RCP WebSocket Bridge**: WebSocket proxy for browser-based clients

### New Components

- **Management API**: REST API for remote management of RCP servers and connections
- **Management Dashboard**: Web interface for monitoring and controlling RCP deployments
- **Flutter Client**: Cross-platform mobile/desktop client using the Flutter framework
- **FFI Integration**: Foreign Function Interface to use RCP client from other languages

## Development Roadmap

1. âœ… Core Protocol Implementation
2. âœ… Basic Server and Client
3. âœ… Service Architecture
4. âœ… Authentication System
5. âœ… WebSocket Bridge
6. ðŸ”„ Management API
   - REST endpoints for system control
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Configuration management
   - Statistics and monitoring
7. ðŸ”„ Management Dashboard
   - Real-time connection monitoring
   - User management interface
   - Service configuration
   - Analytics visualization
8. ðŸ”„ Flutter Client 
   - Cross-platform UI
   - FFI integration with RCP client
   - Optimized mobile experience
   - Offline operation support

## Architecture

RCP follows a modular architecture with these core components:

1. **rcp-core**: Protocol definitions, frame handling, authentication, and common utilities
2. **rcp-server**: The server application that accepts connections and manages sessions
3. **rcp-client**: Client library for connecting to RCP servers and controlling applications
4. **rcp-ws-bridge**: Optional WebSocket bridge for browser clients

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- Core protocol definition (frames, headers)
- Authentication mechanism 
- Server configuration
- Basic session management
- Service interface definition

### In Progress
- Service implementations (display, input, clipboard)
- Application launch and control
- Client library
- Management API
- Management Dashboard
- Flutter Client

### Planned
- Advanced authentication (public key)
- WebSocket bridge
- File transfer service
- Audio streaming service
- Client examples

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow Rust standard style guidelines
- Use `rustfmt` for code formatting
- Document all public APIs with rustdoc comments
- Use appropriate error handling with `thiserror`
- Use `async/await` for asynchronous code

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all core functionality
- Include integration tests for protocol components
- Test both success and error paths

### Protocol Versioning

RCP follows semantic versioning with the following strategy:

- Protocol version is a single byte (0x01 for RCP/1.0)
- Breaking changes require a protocol version increment
- Non-breaking additions use command flags for extension

### Dealing with Concurrent Tasks

When working on the RCP project, it's common to have to switch between different components. Here are guidelines to manage concurrent tasks effectively:

1. **Component separation**: Keep changes contained within their respective modules
2. **Documentation updates**: After implementing a new feature, update relevant docs
3. **Cross-component changes**: When making changes that affect multiple components:
   - Start with the core library
   - Update dependent components in order (core â†’ server â†’ client â†’ bridge)
4. **Testing continuity**: Ensure tests pass after each component update

## Extension Guidelines

### Adding New Commands

To add a new command to the protocol:

1. Add a new variant to the `CommandId` enum in `rcp-core/src/command.rs`
2. Define the command payload structure(s) in the same file
3. Update the command handler in the session implementation

### Adding New Services

To add a new service:

1. Define a new service struct that implements the `Service` trait
2. Add the service to the `ServiceFactory`
3. Update permissions and service subscription handling

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Performance**: Keep overhead minimal, especially for real-time services
- **Security**: Ensure proper authentication and encrypted communications
- **Cross-platform**: Handle platform-specific aspects through abstract interfaces
- **Memory safety**: Avoid unsafe code unless absolutely necessary
- **Resource management**: Properly handle cleanup for all resources
