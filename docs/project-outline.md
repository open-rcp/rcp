# RCP Project Outline and Development Guidelines

This document outlines the Rust/Remote Control Protocol (RCP) project structure, components, and planned development roadmap.

## Project Architecture

RCP follows a modular architecture with several core components that work together in a cohesive system:

### Core Components

1. **rcp-core**: Core protocol library
   - Protocol definitions and frame handling
   - Authentication mechanisms
   - Common utilities

2. **rcpd (RCP Daemon)**: Runtime daemon with integrated components
   - **Server Component**: Integrated component for handling client connections
   - **API Component**: Feature-gated REST API for remote management (optional)
   - Application lifecycle management and configuration
   - Service orchestration

3. **rcp-client**: Client library
   - Connects to RCP servers within the daemon
   - Handles application control and user input
   - Processes and displays streamed frames

4. **rcp-cli**: Command line interface
   - Server administration tool
   - Deliberately maintained as a separate component for separation of concerns
   - Service and user management

5. **rcp-admin**: Administration interface
   - Web interface (SvelteKit-based)
   - Desktop application (Tauri)
   - Server configuration and monitoring

6. **rcp-desk**: End-user client application
   - Virtual application launcher
   - File transfer capabilities
   - User settings and preferences

7. **rcp-ws-bridge**: WebSocket bridge
   - Protocol translation for browser-based clients
   - Frame transcoding for web compatibility
   - Enables web applications to connect without native clients

## Technical Implementation Status

### Current Focus Areas
- Service implementations (display, input, clipboard)
- Application launch and control
- Client library optimization
- Admin interface development
- CLI tool enhancements

### Upcoming Work
- Advanced authentication (public key)
- File transfer service optimization
- Audio streaming service
- Performance tuning
- Multi-platform packaging
- Client examples and documentation

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow Rust standard style guidelines
- Use `rustfmt` for code formatting
- Document all public APIs with rustdoc comments
- Use appropriate error handling with `thiserror`
- Use `async/await` for asynchronous code

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all core functionality
- Include integration tests for protocol components
- Test both success and error paths

### Protocol Versioning

RCP follows semantic versioning with the following strategy:

- Protocol version is a single byte (0x01 for RCP/1.0)
- Breaking changes require a protocol version increment
- Non-breaking additions use command flags for extension

### Dealing with Concurrent Tasks

When working on the RCP project, it's common to have to switch between different components. Here are guidelines to manage concurrent tasks effectively:

1. **Component separation**: Keep changes contained within their respective modules
2. **Documentation updates**: After implementing a new feature, update relevant docs
3. **Cross-component changes**: When making changes that affect multiple components:
   - Start with the core library
   - Update dependent components in order (core â†’ server â†’ client â†’ bridge)
4. **Testing continuity**: Ensure tests pass after each component update

## Extension Guidelines

### Adding New Commands

To add a new command to the protocol:

1. Add a new variant to the `CommandId` enum in `rcp-core/src/command.rs`
2. Define the command payload structure(s) in the same file
3. Update the command handler in the session implementation

### Adding New Services

To add a new service:

1. Define a new service struct that implements the `Service` trait
2. Add the service to the `ServiceFactory`
3. Update permissions and service subscription handling

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Performance**: Keep overhead minimal, especially for real-time services
- **Security**: Ensure proper authentication and encrypted communications
- **Cross-platform**: Handle platform-specific aspects through abstract interfaces
- **Memory safety**: Avoid unsafe code unless absolutely necessary
- **Resource management**: Properly handle cleanup for all resources
