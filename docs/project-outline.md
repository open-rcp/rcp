4. **rcp-cli**: Command-line tool for server administration only
7. **rcp-admin**: Server administration interface for web and desktop
8. **rcp-desk**: End-user client application for accessing virtual applications
9. **rcp-ws-bridge**: Optional WebSocket bridge for browser clients

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow Rust standard style guidelines
- Use `rustfmt` for code formatting
- Document all public APIs with rustdoc comments
- Use appropriate error handling with `thiserror`
- Use `async/await` for asynchronous code

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all core functionality
- Include integration tests for protocol components
- Test both success and error paths

### Protocol Versioning

RCP follows semantic versioning with the following strategy:

- Protocol version is a single byte (0x01 for RCP/1.0)
- Breaking changes require a protocol version increment
- Non-breaking additions use command flags for extension

### Dealing with Concurrent Tasks

When working on the RCP project, it's common to have to switch between different components. Here are guidelines to manage concurrent tasks effectively:

1. **Component separation**: Keep changes contained within their respective modules
2. **Documentation updates**: After implementing a new feature, update relevant docs
3. **Cross-component changes**: When making changes that affect multiple components:
   - Start with the core library
   - Update dependent components in order (core â†’ server â†’ client â†’ bridge)
4. **Testing continuity**: Ensure tests pass after each component update

## Extension Guidelines

### Adding New Commands

To add a new command to the protocol:

1. Add a new variant to the `CommandId` enum in `rcp-core/src/command.rs`
2. Define the command payload structure(s) in the same file
3. Update the command handler in the session implementation

### Adding New Services

To add a new service:

1. Define a new service struct that implements the `Service` trait
2. Add the service to the `ServiceFactory`
3. Update permissions and service subscription handling

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Performance**: Keep overhead minimal, especially for real-time services
- **Security**: Ensure proper authentication and encrypted communications
- **Cross-platform**: Handle platform-specific aspects through abstract interfaces
- **Memory safety**: Avoid unsafe code unless absolutely necessary
- **Resource management**: Properly handle cleanup for all resources
