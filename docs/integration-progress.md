# Server and Service Integration Progress Report

## Overview
We've successfully integrated the RCP server and API functionality into the unified RCP service component. This integration provides a cleaner architecture with a single component that handles both server and API functionality, with the API part being feature-gated.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Structure Updates
- Added library target to `rcp-service/Cargo.toml` with `lib.rs` defining the public API
- Created proper public exports for all necessary modules and types
- Established appropriate feature-gating for the API functionality

### 2. Build Script Updates
- Updated Windows, Linux, and macOS build scripts to use `rcp-service` instead of `rcp-server`
- Added `--service` parameter to build scripts to indicate integrated functionality
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to reflect the new integrated architecture

### 3. Library Interface Implementation
- Created `lib.rs` which exposes the core service functionality through a clean API
- Added re-exports of common types for easier external usage
- Properly feature-gated API-specific functionality

### 4. Test Infrastructure
- Migrated tests to use the library interface rather than direct file imports
- Created new test files (`config_test.rs` and `manager_test.rs`) that use the library interface
- Added `get_work_dir` method to ServiceManager to support testing and client access

### 5. Client Dependency Updates
- Updated the `rcp-admin` dependency to use `rcp-service` with the `api` feature enabled

## Pending Tasks

### 1. Clean Up Warnings
- There are numerous warnings about unused code and fields that should be addressed
- Many of these are expected during the transition but should be reviewed later for potential cleanup

### 2. Original Test Files
- The original test files (`config_tests.rs` and `manager_tests.rs`) with path-based imports need to be phased out
- We should decide whether to remove them or update them to use the library interface

### 3. API Integration Testing
- We need comprehensive tests for the API functionality when enabled via the feature flag
- This should include both unit tests and integration tests for the combined functionality

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Update any remaining documentation to reflect the new unified architecture
- Create examples showing how to use the integrated service

## Next Steps
1. Complete and test the API feature integration
2. Clean up any remaining warnings or legacy code
3. Ensure all clients of the service are updated to use the new library interface
4. Update remaining documentation

## Conclusion
The integration of RCP server and API into the unified RCP service component is largely complete and functional. The new architecture provides a cleaner separation of concerns while maintaining all existing functionality. The feature-gated approach to the API ensures that users who don't need that functionality don't have to include the dependencies.
