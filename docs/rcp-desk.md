- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Seamless remote application experience
- Simple connection management
- File transfer capabilities
- High-performance screen streaming
- Modern, intuitive user interface

## Architecture

RCP Desk follows a streamlined codebase approach:

```
rcp-desk/
├── src/              # Shared components and logic
