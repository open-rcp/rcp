# RCP Documentation Updates Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to unify and optimize the RCP project documentation to reflect the architectural changes and ensure terminology consistency. This includes integration of server and API functionality into the RCP daemon component (formerly called service) and ensuring consistent naming across all documentation.

## Files Updated

1. **server-service-integration.md**
   - Fixed duplicate section numbering in Documentation Updates section
   - Merged redundant sections into a single comprehensive section
   - Added reference to the new consolidated server-service-integration-details document

2. **project-outline.md**
   - Updated component list to show Server and API as components of the RCP service
   - Revised component descriptions to reflect the integrated architecture
   - Updated development roadmap to mark service integration as completed
   - Updated implementation status to reflect completed integration work

3. **roadmap-legacy.md**
   - Changed references from "Server Implementation" to "Server Component Implementation"
   - Updated RCP Service description to mention integrated server component and feature-gated API
   - Marked appropriate tasks as completed based on integration work
   - Added rationale for keeping CLI as a separate component

4. **development-guidelines.md**
   - Restructured table of contents to reflect integrated architecture
   - Changed "Server Implementation" section to "Server Component Implementation"
   - Added proper explanation of the API as a feature-gated component of the service
   - Updated code examples to use the integrated service API

5. **build-scripts.md**
   - Updated command-line options to reflect the unified service with integrated server
   - Added reference to the `--api` flag for enabling the API component

## New Files Created

1. **server-service-integration-details.md**
   - Created a consolidated document that merges the content from:
     - integration-changes.md: Technical implementation details
     - integration-progress.md: Progress tracking and status updates
   - Provides a comprehensive view of the integration work
   - Includes sections on:
     - Directory structure changes
     - Feature gates for API functionality
     - Build script updates
     - Documentation updates
     - Pending tasks and next steps

## Terminology Standardization

Ensured consistent terminology across all documentation:
- "RCP server" is now consistently referred to as a "component" of the RCP service
- API integration is consistently described as "feature-gated"
- CLI is consistently described as "deliberately separate" with clear rationale
- Diagrams consistently show the integrated architecture

## Terminology Consistency Update (May 2025)

### Renamed Components
- `rcp-service` → `rcpdaemon` (RCP Daemon)
- "RCP Service" → "rcpdaemon" or "RCP Daemon"
- "Service" → "Daemon" where referring to the system component

### Updated References
- `ServiceConfig` → `DaemonConfig`
- `Service` class → `Daemon` class
- `/etc/rcp-service/` → `/etc/rcpdaemon/`
- `\\.\pipe\rcp-service` → `\\.\pipe\rcpdaemon`
- `/var/run/rcp-service.sock` → `/var/run/rcpdaemon.sock`

### Updated Commands and Options
- `--server` and `--service` → `--daemon`
- `--run-server` and `--run-service` → `--run-daemon`
- `rcp-cli service` commands → `rcp-cli daemon` commands

### Updated API Endpoints
- `/api/v1/service/*` → `/api/v1/daemon/*`

### Major Files Updated
- `README.md` - Updated component descriptions and references
- `BUILD.md` - Updated build command options
- `architecture.md` - Updated diagrams and component descriptions
- `project-outline.md` - Restructured for clearer component organization
- `rcp-cli.md` - Updated service management to daemon management
- `rcp-api.md` - Updated API endpoint references
- `development-guidelines.md` - Updated code examples and descriptions

### New Documentation Created
- `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md` - Clear overview of project organization
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Fast onboarding for new developers

## Conclusion

The documentation now accurately reflects the current architectural state where the server and API functionality are integrated into the RCP daemon component, with the CLI deliberately kept separate. All references to the old separated architecture have been updated or removed to ensure consistency across the documentation. Additionally, terminology has been standardized across all components to use "daemon" instead of "service" for the main system component.
