# Documentation Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to refactor the documentation to align with the current project implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Core Architecture Documentation

The architecture documentation was updated to reflect the current three-component structure:
- `rcpp` - Protocol library
- `rcpc` - Client library and CLI interface
- `rcpd` - Daemon with integrated server and API

### 2. Created Component-Specific Documentation

Created or updated detailed documentation for each component:
- `rcpp.md` - Documentation for the protocol library
- `rcpc.md` - Documentation for the client library
- `rcpd.md` - Updated documentation for the daemon

### 3. Updated Build Documentation

Modified build-scripts.md to reflect current component names and build options:
- Updated component references from `service`/`client` to `rcpd`/`rcpc`/`rcpp`
- Updated examples with current command-line options
- Fixed inconsistencies in script usage descriptions

### 4. Archived Outdated Documentation

Moved outdated documentation to the docs/archive/ directory:
- `integration-changes.md` - Integration steps already completed
- `integration-progress.md` - Progress tracking for completed work
- `server-service-integration.md` - Details on already-completed integration
- `server-service-integration-details.md` - Technical details of completed integration
- `documentation-update-summary.md` - Summary of previous documentation updates
- `roadmap-legacy.md` - Outdated roadmap information
- `rcp-api.md` - API now integrated into rcpd
- `rcp-cli.md` - CLI now part of rcpc and rcpd
- `rcp-service.md` - Renamed to rcpd

### 5. Updated Project Outline

Modified project-outline.md to:
- Focus on current three-component structure
- Update implementation status
- Clarify component responsibilities and relationships
- Better reflect the current development state

### 6. Refactored Build Scripts

Updated build scripts in the `scripts` directory to align with the current component structure:
- Renamed component arguments from `--service`, `--client`, etc. to `--rcpp`, `--rcpc`, `--rcpd`
- Added support for building and running specific components
- Updated feature flags and options to match current functionality
- Created a comprehensive README for the scripts directory
- Added a development workflow guide

### 7. Added Development Workflow Documentation

Created a new document `development-workflow.md` that:
- Describes the recommended development workflow
- Explains how to build and test each component
- Provides guidance for common development tasks
- Includes troubleshooting information

## Current Documentation Structure

The documentation is now organized as follows:

```
docs/
├── architecture.md           # System architecture overview
├── build-scripts.md          # Build script usage and options
├── development-guidelines.md # Guidelines for developers
├── documentation-refactoring.md # This document
├── project-outline.md        # Project structure and roadmap
├── protocol-specification.md # Detailed protocol specification
├── rcp-admin.md             # Future admin interface (planned)
├── rcp-desk.md              # Future desktop client (planned)
├── rcp-flutter-client.md    # Future mobile client (planned)
├── rcpc.md                  # RCP Client documentation
├── rcpd-installation.md     # RCPD installation guide
├── rcpd.md                  # RCPD documentation
├── rcpp.md                  # RCP Protocol documentation
└── archive/                 # Archived documentation
```

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Clarity**: Documentation now accurately reflects the current implementation
2. **Better Onboarding**: New developers can more easily understand the project structure
3. **Reduced Confusion**: Outdated information is archived rather than removed
4. **Consistent Terminology**: Component names are used consistently across all documentation

- Updated build script options to reflect current component names
- Updated examples to use the current component names
- Removed references to legacy components

### 4. Simplified Documentation Structure

- Archived legacy documentation files that are no longer relevant
- Consolidated documentation to focus on current implementation
- Removed redundant/outdated integration documentation

### 5. Updated README.md

- Updated repository structure to match current implementation
- Ensured accurate component descriptions

## Archived Documentation

The following documentation files were archived as they're no longer relevant to the current implementation:

1. `integration-changes.md` - Integration already completed
2. `integration-progress.md` - Integration already completed
3. `server-service-integration.md` - Integration already completed
4. `server-service-integration-details.md` - Integration already completed
5. `documentation-update-summary.md` - Meta-document no longer needed
6. `roadmap-legacy.md` - Legacy roadmap
7. `rcp-api.md` - Now part of rcpd
8. `rcp-service.md` - Renamed to rcpd
9. `rcp-cli.md` - Now part of rcpc and rcpd

## Next Steps

To further improve the documentation:

1. Enhance test documentation
2. Add more code examples for using the components
3. Create detailed API documentation for each public interface
4. Add diagrams to illustrate component interactions
