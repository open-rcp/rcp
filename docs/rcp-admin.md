# RCP Admin

This document outlines the RCP Admin, an administrative interface for managing RCP server deployments across web and desktop platforms.

## Overview

RCP Admin is a unified administrative interface designed to provide comprehensive server management capabilities. It gives administrators full control over RCP server configurations, application publishing, user management, and system monitoring.

## Architecture

RCP Admin follows a unified codebase approach:

```
rcp-admin/
├── src/              # Shared components and logic
├── assets/           # Images, icons, and other static assets
└── src-tauri/        # Desktop app implementation (Tauri)
```

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: SvelteKit
- **Desktop Integration**: Tauri
- **API Communication**: Fetch API, WebSockets
- **State Management**: Svelte stores
- **UI Components**: Custom component library
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with secure storage

## Features

The RCP Admin provides the following key features:

### Server Management
- Start, stop, and restart RCP servers
- Configure server network settings
- Manage TLS certificates
- Set authentication requirements

### Application Management
- Publish virtual applications
- Configure application paths and arguments
- Set application permissions
- Manage file associations
- Monitor application usage

### User Administration
- Create and manage user accounts
- Assign user roles and permissions
- View user activity logs
- Set password policies

### Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time server statistics
- Session monitoring
- Resource utilization graphs
- Error and event logging

## Desktop Application (Tauri)

The desktop version offers additional benefits:

- Native performance and resource efficiency
- System tray integration
- Desktop notifications
- Local system integration
- Offline capability with synchronization

### Installation

```bash
# Install desktop app
cargo run -p rcp-admin -- --desktop-install

# Run desktop app
cargo run -p rcp-admin
```

## Web Application

The web interface provides flexibility and accessibility:

- Access from any modern browser
- No installation required
- Consistent experience across devices
- Automatic updates

### Deployment

```bash
# Build web app
cargo run -p rcp-admin -- --web-build

# Serve web app
cargo run -p rcp-admin -- --web-serve
```

## Security Considerations

RCP Admin implements several security measures:

- JWT-based authentication with short expiration
- HTTPS/TLS for all web communications
- CSRF protection
- Content Security Policy
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging of administrative actions

## Customization

The admin interface can be customized through:

- Theme configuration files
- Custom plugins
- Layout adjustments
- Branding elements
- Language localization

## Integration

RCP Admin integrates with other RCP components:

- Uses RCP Server libraries directly for management
- Communicates with RCP Service for system-level operations
- Provides configuration to RCP CLI
- Supports RCP API for remote management

## Implementation Plan

1. Core interface development (SvelteKit)
2. Server management functionality
3. Application configuration interfaces
4. User management panels
5. Monitoring and reporting dashboards
6. Tauri desktop application wrapper
7. Security hardening
8. Web deployment options
