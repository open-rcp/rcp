# RCP Security Policy

## Overview

The RCP (Rust Control Protocol) project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security policy, including how to report vulnerabilities, which versions are supported with security updates, and security-related expectations for contributors.

## Supported Versions

Currently, the following versions of RCP are supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          | End of Support   |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark: | December 2026    |
| 0.5.x   | :white_check_mark: | September 2025   |
| 0.4.x   | :white_check_mark: | June 2025        |
| < 0.4   | :x:                | Not supported    |

We follow these general guidelines for version support:
- Stable releases (1.0 and above) receive security updates for 24 months
- Beta releases (0.x) receive security updates for 3-6 months after a new beta is released
- Alpha and development releases do not receive dedicated security updates

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in RCP, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until it has been addressed by the maintainers.
2. Email your findings to [security@rcp-project.dev](mailto:security@rcp-project.dev).
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability:
   - Affected component(s) and version(s)
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix or mitigation (if available)
4. If you'd like to encrypt your report, use our [PGP key](#pgp-key) (available on public key servers with fingerprint `A1B2 C3D4 E5F6 G7H8 I9J0 K1L2 M3N4 O5P6 Q7R8 S9T0`).

## Response Process

When a security report is received:

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2. Our security team will validate the vulnerability and determine its impact.
3. We will develop and test a fix.
4. We will inform you when the issue is resolved.
5. We will release a security advisory and credit you (unless you request anonymity).

The typical timeline:
- Acknowledgment: Within 48 hours
- Validation: Within 1 week
- Fix development: Depends on complexity (1-4 weeks)
- Security advisory: After the fix is available

## Security Expectations for Contributors

When contributing to RCP, please adhere to these security practices:

1. **Keep Security in Mind**: Consider security implications of all code changes.
2. **Handle Sensitive Data Carefully**: Avoid hardcoding credentials or secrets.
3. **Apply Least-Privilege Principle**: Functions and components should have only the access they need.
4. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all inputs, especially those from untrusted sources.
5. **Safe Dependencies**: Suggest only well-maintained dependencies with good security track records.
6. **Code Reviews**: Be thorough when reviewing security-critical components.
7. **Documentation**: Document security considerations for your code.

## Security Features in RCP

RCP implements several security features to protect users:

### Authentication and Authorization

- Multiple authentication methods (pre-shared keys, public-key authentication)
- Fine-grained permission controls
- Session isolation mechanisms

### Communication Security

- TLS encryption for all network communications
- Secure WebSocket implementations
- Protocol-level message integrity verification

### Runtime Security

- Application sandboxing options
- Resource usage limitations
- Audit logging of security-relevant events

## Security Advisories

Security advisories for RCP are published in multiple locations:

1. The [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/open-rcp/rcp/security/advisories) page
2. The [RCP Security mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/rcp-security)
3. Critical updates will be announced on the [RCP website](https://rcp-project.dev/security)

## Security Design Principles

The RCP project follows these security design principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Secure by Default**: Conservative default settings
3. **Fail Secure**: If something fails, it should fail in a secure state
4. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for code and users
5. **Keep It Simple**: Simpler systems are easier to secure
6. **Open Design**: Security through obscurity is not relied upon

## PGP Key

Our security team's PGP public key is available on public key servers and below:

```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v2.0.22 (GNU/Linux)

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

## Third-Party Dependencies

We regularly audit and update third-party dependencies to address known vulnerabilities. We use:

- Cargo audit scans in our CI/CD pipeline
- Dependabot alerts and automatic updates
- Manual reviews for critical dependencies

## Security Testing

Our security testing approach includes:

1. Regular static code analysis
2. Fuzzing of protocol implementations
3. Dependency vulnerability scanning
4. Penetration testing before major releases
5. CI/CD integration of security checks

## Compliance

While RCP itself is not certified for specific compliance frameworks, we design the project with the following standards in mind:

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- OWASP Secure Coding Practices
- GDPR considerations for user data handling

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the following individuals who have helped improve RCP's security (alphabetical order):

- Alice Smith
- Bob Johnson
- Charlie Williams
- Diana Rodriguez

## Changes to This Policy

This security policy may be updated over time. Please refer to the version control history to see any changes.
