# RCP Admin Interface

A modern web-based administration interface for the Rust/Remote Control Protocol (RCP) system.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/UI
- **Backend**: Rust with Axum web framework, integrated with rcpdaemon
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live monitoring
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control

## Features

### Core Administration
- 🖥️ Server management and monitoring
- 👥 User management and permissions
- 📱 Application configuration and deployment
- 📊 Session monitoring and control
- 📈 Real-time analytics and logs

### Advanced Features
- 🔐 Security policy management
- 🌐 Multi-server cluster management
- 📁 File transfer monitoring
- 🎛️ System configuration
- 📋 Audit logging

## Development Lifecycle

Following the redundant development lifecycle you specified:

1. **Brainstorming** → Analyze requirements and plan features
2. **Documenting** → Create comprehensive docs and specs
3. **Writing Test Cases** → Implement comprehensive testing
4. **Writing Code** → Develop features with TDD approach
5. **Compile and Testing** → Build and validate functionality
6. **Reporting** → Generate reports and metrics
7. **Fixing** → Address issues and improvements
8. **Brainstorming** → Iterate and improve

## Getting Started

```bash
# Backend development
cd backend
cargo run

# Frontend development  
cd web
npm run dev
```

## Integration

The admin interface integrates seamlessly with your existing RCP ecosystem:
- Uses `rcpdaemon` API for server management
- Leverages `rcpcore` protocol definitions
- Integrates with authentication from `rcpdaemon`
- Provides management for `rcpclient` applications
