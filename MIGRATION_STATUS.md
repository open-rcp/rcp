# Migration Process Update

## Current Status (Updated: May 16, 2025)

Significant progress has been made in adding the CLI functionality to the RCPD daemon:

1. Added CLI feature flag to rcpd's Cargo.toml
2. Created necessary CLI module structure (cli.rs, cli/error.rs, etc.)
3. Implemented CLI command handlers for all required commands:
   - config
   - server
   - service
   - app
   - user
   - session
   - completions
   - diag
4. Created a CLI service client for communicating with the daemon
5. Updated main.rs with hierarchical command structure
6. Added tests for CLI command parsing

## Command Module Status

| Module | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| config.rs | Implemented | Basic configuration functionality complete |
| server.rs | Implemented | Server management functionality complete |
| service.rs | Implemented | Service management functionality complete |
| app.rs | Implemented | Application management functionality complete |
| user.rs | Implemented | User management functionality complete |
| session.rs | Implemented | Session management functionality complete |
| completions.rs | Implemented | Shell completion generation complete |
| diag.rs | Implemented | Diagnostic commands complete |
| logs.rs | Not Implemented | Log viewing functionality missing |
| auth.rs | Not Planned | Low priority for initial migration |
| batch.rs | Not Planned | Low priority for initial migration |
| shell.rs | Not Planned | Low priority for initial migration |

## Next Steps

To complete the migration of rcp-cli into rcpd, the following steps are still needed:

1. **Port Optional Low-Priority Commands**
   - logs.rs: Log management (currently handled via diag module)
   - auth.rs: Authentication utilities (if needed)
   - batch.rs: Batch processing (if needed)
   - shell.rs: Interactive shell (if needed)

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Test CLI commands against a running daemon
   - Ensure proper error handling and output formatting
   - Create integration tests for common workflows

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update user documentation to reflect the new CLI structure
   - Create usage examples for common tasks
   - Add deprecation notices for rcp-cli

## Using the Current Implementation

While the integration is not complete, you can continue working with the existing rcp-cli and rcpd components separately.

## Implementation Challenges

The main issue encountered is integrating the CLI command structure into the existing daemon command structure. This will require a more careful revision of the main function to support both daemon operation and CLI commands.

## Recommendation

Complete the remaining implementation work incrementally:

1. First make the CLI feature work with basic commands (status, config)
2. Then add more complex commands (app, user management)
3. Finally integrate authentication and secure communication between components
